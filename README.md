- 👋 Hi, I’m @Duje1967
- 👀 I’m interested in playing electric guitar, blogging and writing books.But what I don't know is how to write a text on Wikipedia ... 
     I was trying so the critics wrote me that I wrote an essay about myself. But I still think I have a place on Wikipedia, 
     because I recorded the first album of the rock band "Mothers"- "Reason and Madness" in 1990 and I wrote after the war in which 
     I participated two books: "The Diary of a Grandson" and "The Hate Highway". 
     Today I have a blog with over 2,000,000 visitors and with over 10,000 likes. 
     If anyone can help write a text for Wikipedia, I will gladly accept it. Thank you in advance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning not to change the world, but to change in myself.
- 💞️ I'm looking for collaboration with people to whom life has given a REAL second chance.
